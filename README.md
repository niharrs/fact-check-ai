# YouTube Fact Checker

## Overview

YouTube Fact Checker is a Python-based project that takes a YouTube video link as input and extracts 10 random facts from the audio. It then uses AI models from OpenAI, including GPT, Whisper, and Google's Bard to check if these facts are correct. 
The project aims to help users verify the accuracy of information presented in YouTube videos, promoting fact-checking and informed decision-making.
